`[R | SVM | Tableau]`

Welcome to the "Sales Lead Conversion Predictive Analytics Reports" repository! This repository showcases the final reports from the course "Domain Applications of Predictive Analytics." The primary objective of this course was to select a real-world dataset related to E-learning courses, analyze it, and propose a predictive solution for identifying potential leads.

**Abstract:**

In today's business landscape, leads play a pivotal role as they serve as the driving force behind any successful organization. With the surge of subscription-based business models, particularly among start-ups, the ability to convert leads into paying customers has become more crucial than ever. A lead refers to a prospective customer who demonstrates interest in purchasing a product or service. Marketing and sales departments dedicate substantial time, resources, and effort to lead management, encompassing three critical phases: lead generation, qualification, and monetization.

This research project focuses on designing a project that analyzes existing information about leads interested in enrolling in a program at an academic institution. Leveraging this data, predictive analytics techniques are employed to develop a solution for lead management.
