This repository shows the final reports of the course "Domain Applications of Predictive Analytics", in which the main goal was to select a real-world data set (E-learning courses), analyse it and propose and Predictive solution for the required purpose (to identify potential Leads).

**Abstract**—Today, leads are the motivation for any business. With the rise of subscription-based business models, especially among start-ups, the ability to convert leads into paying cus- tomers has never been more important. A ”lead” is a potential consumer who is interested in purchasing your goods or service. Marketing and sales departments devote a large amount of time, money, and effort to lead management, which we define as the three critical phases of lead creation, qualifying, and monetizing. In this research, a project design is provided in relation to analysis of existing information on leads who want to register in a program at an academic institution, and the data is leveraged for predictive analytics.
